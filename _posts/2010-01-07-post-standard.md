As an internet native, I frequently encounter oddly fascinating turns of phrase. This is a flame-proof filing cabinet.



## A Letter Written about one of the First Japanese Cats
(Credit to Mckinley Valentine of The Whippet)

Japan’s first cat
We don’t know when cats first came to Japan, but it was thousands of years later than they came to Europe. The first recorded incident of a cat in Japan — in text or artwork — is March 11, 889 AD.

Seventeen-year-old Emperor Uda writes:

“On the 6th Day of the 2nd Month of the First Year of the Kampo era. Taking a moment of my free time, I wish to express my joy of the cat. It arrived by boat as a gift to the late Emperor, received from the hands of Minamoto no Kuwashi.

The color of the fur is peerless. None could find the words to describe it, although one said it was reminiscent of the deepest ink. It has an air about it, similar to Kanno. Its length is 5 sun, and its height is 6 sun. [1 sun = ~3cm/1.2 in. Must be a kitten.] I affixed a bow about its neck, but it did not remain for long.

In rebellion, it narrows its eyes and extends its needles. It shows its back.

When it lies down, it curls in a circle like a coin. You cannot see its feet. It’s as if it were circular Bi disk. When it stands, its cry expresses profound loneliness, like a black dragon floating above the clouds.

By nature, it likes to stalk birds. It lowers its head and works its tail. It can extend its spine to raise its height by at least 2 sun. Its color allows it to disappear at night. I am convinced it is superior to all other cats.”

Tell me what’s changed.


## There should be a Guy
(Credit to Max Lavergne)

There should be a guy who every morning rides his bicycle down to the main street and sets up a small glass case of beautiful cakes he has made. He should sell the cakes at a reasonable price to whoever comes. The cakes should be both beautiful and inspiring. They should be sumptuously iced and decorated with fruits and sugared flowers which are not only lovely to behold but genuinely delicious. He should sit on a low half wall and read a newspaper folded into quarters until the cakes are all sold. As soon as the last one is sold he should tie the glass case to the back of his bike and cycle to the market to buy fresh eggs and flour, chocolate, fruit, all the things he needs to make cakes for tomorrow. And then he should ride his bicycle home, where he should kiss the top of the low door frame leading into his widower’s cottage because it will always remind him of her. And then he makes the cakes for the next day. Now that’s what should happen. It should be happening already, in towns all over the country. Hell, all over the world. If it’s not then ---- it. Let the bombs fall. Let them turn the beaches to glass. Return us to hunter gatherers, cowering in caves. Miserable dirty people dying of cold when it rains for too long. Let us slowly work our way back up if we can’t get even that part right when it should be so obvious. See if the next crop are smarter. And if they aren’t then try again. As long as it takes. Let our distant descendants hide in the shadows of the brick walls we built. I don’t think that’s too extreme.

## The Flash
(Credit to Italo Calvino)
It happened one day, at a crossroads, in the middle of a crowd, people coming and going.
       I stopped, blinked: suddently I understood nothing. Nothing, nothing about anything: I did not understand the reasons for things or for people, it was all senseless, absurd. I laughed.
       What I found strange at the time was that I had never realized before; that up until then I had accepted everything: traffic lights, cars, posters, uniforms, monuments, things completely detached from any sense of the world, accepted them as if there were some necessity, some chain of cause and effect that bound them together.
       Then my laugh died. I blushed, ashamed. I waved to get people's attention. "Stop a moment!" I shouted, "there is something wrong! Everything is wrong! We are doing the absurdest things. This cannot be the right way. Where can it end?"
       People stopped around me, sized me up, curious. I stood there in the middle of them, waving my arms, desparate to explain myself, to have them share the flash of insight that had suddenly enlightened me: and I said nothing. I said nothing because the moment I had raised my arms and opened my mouth, my great revelation had been as it were swallowed up again and the words had come out any old how, on impulse.
       "So?" people asked, "what do you mean? Everything is in its place. All is as it should be. Everything is a result of something else. Everything fits in with everything else. We cannot see anything wrong or absurd."
       I stood there, lost, because as I saw it now everything had fallen into place again and everything seemed normal, traffic lights, monuments, uniforms, towerblocks, tramlines, begggards, processions; yet this did not calm me, it tormented me.
       "I am sorry," I said. "Perhaps it was I who was wrong. It seemd that way then. But everything is fine now. I am sorry." And I made off amid their angry glares.
       Yet, even now, every time (and it is often) that I find I do not understand something, then, instincitively, I am filled with the hope that perhaps this will be my moment again, perhaps once again I shall understand nothing, I shall grasp the other knowledge, found and lost in an instant.
       
## Mr. Palomar Excerpt
(Credit to Italo Calvino)
Mr. Palomar does not underestimate the advantages that the condition of being alive can have over that of being dead: not as regards the future, where risks are always very great and benefits can be of short duration, but in the sense of the possibility of improving the form of one's own past. (Unless one is already fully satisfied with one's own past, a situation too uninteresting to make it worth investigating.) A person's life consists of a collection of events, the last of which could also change the meaning of the whole, not because it counts more than the previous ones but because once they are included in a life, events are arranged in an order that is not chronological but, rather, corresponds to an inner architecture. A person, for example, reads in adulthood a book that is important for him, and it makes him say, "How could I have lived without having read it!," and also, "What a pity I did not read it in my youth!" Well, these statements do not have much meaning, especially the second, because after he has read that book, his whole life becomes the life of a person who has read that book, and it is of little importance whether he read it early or late, because now his life before that reading also assumes a form shaped by that reading.

This is the most difficult step in learning how to be dead: to become convinced that your own life is a closed whole, all in the past, to which you can add nothing and can alter none of the relationships among the various elements. Of course, those who go on living can, according to their shifting experience, intoduce changes in the lives of the dead, too, giving form to what had none or what seemed to have a different form: recognizing, for example, a just rebel in someone who had been vituperated for his lawless actions, celebrating a poet or a prophet in one who had felt doomed to neurosis or delirium. But these are changes that matter mostly to the living. It is unlikely that they, the dead, will profit by them. Each individual is made up of what he has lived and the way he lived it, and no one can take this away from him. Anyone who has lived in suffering is always made of that suffering; if they try to take it away from him, he is no longer himself.

## Assorted Observations by the Cryptonaturalist
(Credit to Jarod K. Anderson)
Collect objects infused with stories. Buy a hand-carved wooden spoon. Rescue and refinish a table. Put original art on your walls. It doesn't need to be costly, just rich in story. Save yourself from the feeling that you're sinking beneath the bulk of gray, lifeless products.
 
Humans are atom shepherds,
Tending our bodies. 
Flocks of cells coaxed into action.
One day, our sheep will go,
And in pastures of flowers or stars,
They will wear our gentle touches
Like ivy woven into their wool.
Let them walk with our blessing
To the green hills of forever.
 
When magic calls you to the deep woods, it will be dangerous.
Go anyway.
Why not? 
We are armored with impermanence, we fragile humans.
Go. 
Go because you want to. 
Because, in the end, that want creates all you are.
Go.
Because anything that breaks you must also make you whole.
 
Studying literature means I've seen, century after century, folks who were certain the world was ending. And, of course, they were always half-right. Their world was ending. Their time/context. A world can end on a micro or macro scale and with equal subjective significance.
Before deciding some effort/action is pointless, hold your assessment up to these five truths: Nothing is forever. Experiences are assets. All creation is imperfect. Payment and worth are different things. Enjoyment is a valuable outcome by itself.
One day, your skull will be as empty as a conch shell on a fence post,
full of wind and gentle quiet.
 
The universe is an ongoing explosion. 
That's where you live. 
In an explosion. 
We absolutely don't know what living is.
Sometimes atoms just get very haunted.
That's us.
When an explosion explodes hard enough, dust wakes up and thinks about itself.
 
 
Life isn't a game.
It's walking a woodland path
collecting stones.
You won't win or lose.
There will be no single rock,
heavy as silence,
that crowns you worthy
of your heartbeat.
That crown sprouts
like antlers from your own skull
when you ask Earth
to take root in your
bones.
If you write out the basic facts of trees, but framed as technology, it sounds like impossible sci-fi nonsense. Self-replicating, solar-powered machines that synthesize carbon dioxide and rainwater into oxygen and sturdy building materials on a planetary scale.
 
Today, it’s a cauldron of ghosts. 
Flesh and electricity.
Water and memory. 
A machine that makes reality.
Now. Here. Your skull is the garden where fact flowers into meaning.
 
No job title or degree or sum of money or romantic attention or public recognition is going to make you feel whole and successful unless they awaken in you the generosity to grant those things to yourself, a power you can reach for at any time without aid, artifice, or accolade.
 
The earliest cephalopods date back to the Cambrian period. They predate trees and land plants. So, the Earth knew tentacles before it knew leaves. Anyway, sweet dreams.
 
Take time to be a wild thing, if only to remind yourself that civilization is not the whole world.
 
Your bones are an essay
written by Earth in the language of gravity.  
Letters shaped in mineral ink.
In each of our bodies, is this text of stone, 
punctuated with ivy and sea salt. 
How clever to ensconce us within the skull,
a captive audience, 
a reader who is also the page.
 
A human wondering about death is like a snowflake considering its fall toward the sea.
The fear is in losing the self, the stark distinction of crystalline borders.
The comfort is in seeking to remember the effortless unity of the waters below.
 
See a bird and dismiss it.
See a bird and learn its species.
See a bird and study its behavior.
See a bird and question the physics of flight.
See a bird and trace its DNA back to the dinosaurs.
Life can pass over us unnoticed or be rich in poetry.
Curiosity is worth the effort.
 
The water in your body is just visiting. It was a thunderstorm a week ago. It will be the ocean soon enough. Most of your cells come and go like morning dew. We are more weather pattern than stone monument. Sunlight on mist. Summer lightning. Your choices outweigh your substance.
 
I’m not needed here.
Acorns aren’t needed, nor white-throated sparrows.
Our not-quite-round Earth isn’t needed.
All of us needlessly disturbing the pristine nothing of the neighborhood.
Yet, we’re here.
And need had no say in it.
So, as in art and kindness,
needlessness is best.

“To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.”
