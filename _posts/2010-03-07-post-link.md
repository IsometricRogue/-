Most people don’t do mathematics for recreation. In part, this is probably due to our schooling, which positions “school mathematics” as the only type of mathematics that most of us experience. You can go your whole life thinking of “mathematics” as calculations, a bit of algebra, and maybe the quadratic formula. In most Kindergarten to grade 12 curricula, calculus and algebra are the peaks of mathematics learning, with the early grades a steady march through mastering calculation skills, and on to more abstract “things”, which then serve as gatekeepers for who gets to do college or university mathematics. This is the approved knowledge base that is used to prepare us for life and work, debatable though it is (what topics are to be included, and why?)
Once our formal schooling is over, we probably have little pieces of mathematics that we use in our jobs and lives: measurements, taxes, and so on. Doing mathematics purely for recreation is not really a consideration to most people. Relaxation time in the evenings is usually given over to less taxing pursuits.
But what if we did mathematics purely for recreation, rather than for research, or for practical reasons?
If you had bad experiences with school mathematics, this idea may make you cringe, or inspire fear. Why do that, you might ask? My answer to this is also my answer to many things: because it’s interesting. At risk of tautology, I might state this as an axiom of life:
It’s interesting to think about interesting things.
The category “recreational mathematics” has and should include things like puzzles, chess problems, sudoku, logic puzzles, and games. There should be something for everyone in this category.
Martin Gardner’s column in Scientific American, which ran from 1956 to 1981, was called “Mathematical Games”, and spawned many of the most well-known recreational math problems. It is worth noting that Gardner himself wasn’t a world-class mathematician.
In 2004, he had this to say:
>I go up to calculus, and beyond that I don’t understand any of the papers that are being written. I consider that that was an advantage for the type of column I was doing because I had to understand what I was writing about, and that enabled me to write in such a way that an average reader could understand what I was saying. If you are writing popularly about math, I think it’s good not to know too much math. (AMS interview, quoted on Wikipedia)

>“Perhaps in playing with these puzzles you will discover that mathematics is more delightful than you expected.”
Martin Gardner. (Entertaining Mathematical Puzzles, 1961).
The line between entertaining math and serious math is a blurry one. Many professional mathematicians regard their work as a form of play, in the same way professional golfers or basketball stars might.
You might say that math *is* play (or at least it *can* be).
