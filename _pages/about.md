I created this website primarily for the Communications Merit Badge. I will be using it the future as a simple way to reliably store any information I want to keep.
After all, I'm depending on Github's servers, which unlike paper, I can't lose. ( much easier to store links online than meticulously written down )

I may store professional information here eventually.
